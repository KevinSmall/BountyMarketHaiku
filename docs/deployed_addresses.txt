# Deployed Addresses
Deploy your application onto the Rinkeby test network. Include a document called deployed_addresses.txt that describes where your contracts live on the test net.

## Interacting with Deployed Contract
Interact with it in Remix (paste in code found in folder /remix/BountyMarketHaikuFlattened.sol) or use the Etherscan "Write Contract" beta:
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x3d8d27e0577d4e4f2dfdcf772a7f556a9036d21f#writeContract

In both cases, use MetaMask to connect to Rinkeby.

My JavaScript knowledge was not sufficient to let me configure the UI to work with this deployement.
